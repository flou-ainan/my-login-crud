# LOGIN AND SESSION CRUD API PROJECT
Made with:
- NodeJS
- MongoDB (Via Mongoose)
- Express
- TypeScript

## Overall Description and Motivation
This project is being built for me to learn better the backend part of webdevelopment. I've already studied all separated topics in tutorials and simple implementations before getting my hands trully dirty within a new project from scratch tha uinites everything in this one project.

I,ve choosen it to be an API because I think this way its more secure and flexible. I am going to make a frontend for this project using `Next.JS` after the conclusion of the alpha version and it will be linked here.

## Why these Technologies
Most of my decisions were made based in widely adoption, easy of use, opensource and good documentation.
### MongoDB
Its a very good Opensource database that is very easy to setup and use, specially through `Mongoose`.
Widely adopted by the comunity and has a nice free cloud with 512mb space, `MongoDB Atlas`.
### Node.JS
Its a very popular environment that runs Javascript out of the Browser. It's not just a runtime, it comes with lot of desireable features and tools that show advantages over other backend languages in my experience:
- Its Javascript, and I'm already a JS developer.
- It comes with `NPM` that can download and control a huge set of modules that helps a lot in development.
- I'm used to use Node and npm in production of my Frontend `React`/`NextJS` projects.
### Express
Its the most popular server node module/framework and its easy to build a simple `CRUD` with it.
### Mongoose
A node module for handling the server and MongoDB operations.
Again its the most popular way that I found in the comunity to learn and use MongoDB through NodeJS.
### Typescript
It's kinda new for me, but its very good to have strong Typing and better Object Oriented Features under Javascript that is a language that i learned to like a lot. Years ago I learned to code in Java and loved OOP. So its very good to combine the old and new knoledge.
It's very standard on business projects too, so I wanted to learn it very well.
